## The 0/1 Knapsack Prolem
##### A project from Fall 2015

Abstract
========
A common problem that could be solved in many different ways, the knapsack problem is a problem where one may run into. Trying to decide what items to take that combine to make the most value without exceeding the weight of the knapsack. Do we take this item (1), or do leave this item (0) out of the knapsack? We cannot split these items, they must be whole when inserted into the knapsack, and therefore we cannot use the greedy algorithm. One of the questions that one may stumble upon is which item will give me the optimal value? Would it be item 1, or 3? Each distinct item has its own properties, the weight of the item, and the value of the item. To conduct the optimal value of these items, the user must set how many items would be available to put into the knapsack. We must compare the values first and determine if it is beneficial to exclude or to keep the item.
